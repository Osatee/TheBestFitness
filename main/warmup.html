        the muscles are destroyed And waste products are produced in various
        cells. Cool down is the best way to maintain the level. And get rid of
        the waste that the body creates while exercising. It should take about
        5-10 minutes to stretch the muscles. By doing it in a way that stretches
        the muscles by holding each position for 10-15 seconds, stopping the
        exercise abruptly without Cool down will cause fainting. Dizziness or
